# PopularMovies

Here is a fully functional and user friendly android app which I made from scratch for [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801) program. 

This app help users to discover the most popular, the highest rated and the highest-grossing movies.
It reveals the power of adaptive UI both for phone and tablet devices.It includes various new Lollipop+ features.

Popular Movies was highly evaluated by certified Udacity code reviewer and was graded as **"Exceeds Specifications"**.
